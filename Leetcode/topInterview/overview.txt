I have begun practicing the "Top Interview 150" challenge on LeetCode to improve my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.
This challenge consists of 150 problems that are frequently asked in interviews, covering various topics and difficulty levels, which will help me become more proficient in problem-solving and algorithm design.
