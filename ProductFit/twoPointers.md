## Two Pointers


The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving searching or iterating through arrays, strings, or linked lists.

It involves using two indices (pointers) to traverse the data structure in a specific way.

Two pointers reduce unnecessary computations and efficiently find the solution to the problem.

- unidirectional
- inwards directional
- staged directional

 when to use
 ------------

 - When the problem involves searching for pairs, triplets, or subarrays.
 - When the data structure is sorted or can be sorted.
 - When the goal is to optimize the solution to linear or near-linear complexity.-

### unidirectional

**1.arrange zero**



### inward directional

**1.two sum**
**2.three sum**
**3.container with most water**
**4.valid palindrome**

### staged directional

**1.next permutation**
