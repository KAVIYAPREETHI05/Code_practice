### Line Configuration in Computer Networks

For communication to occur, two devices must be connected in some way to the same link at the same time. There are two possible types of connections: 

1. Point-to-Point Connection

2. Multipoint Connection

**Point-to-Point**

A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two devices.

The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two devices.

**Example** - remote control and television

**Multi-Point**

It is also called Multidrop configuration. In this connection, two or more devices share a single link.

If more than two devices share the link then the channel is considered a ‘shared channel’. 

Uses a single link to connect three or more devices

Devices share the same link, which can lead to collisions and lower performance

**Example** - wifi networks, hub topology

**Spatial Sharing:** If several devices can share the link simultaneously, it’s called Spatially shared line configuration. 

**Temporal (Time) Sharing:** If users must take turns using the link, then it’s called Temporally shared or Time Shared Line configuration.
