## TYPES OF COMPUTER NETWORK


 - Personal Area Network (PAN)
 - Local Area Network (LAN)
 - Campus Area Network (CAN)
 - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
 - Wide Area Network (WAN)

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

It is a type of network designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person.

network range of 1 to 100 meters from person to device.

This uses Bluetooth, IrDA, and Zigbee as technology. 

Examples of PAN are USB, computer, phone, tablet, printer, PDA, etc.

### Local Area Network (LAN)

A LAN is a computer network that connects computers through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, that is, locally.

ranges up to 2km 

use  Ethernet and Wi-fi technology

Examples of LAN are networking in a home, school, library, laboratory, college, office, etc

### Campus Area Network (CAN)

This network covers a limited geographical area that is, it spreads across several buildings within the campus. 

range from 1km to 5km. 
 
use Ethernet technology 

Examples of CAN are networks that cover schools, colleges, buildings, etc.

###  Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

This is the type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town, or metropolitan area.

range from 5km to 50km

This network mainly uses FDDI, CDDI, and ATM as the technology 

Examples of MAN are networking in towns, cities, a single large city, a large area within multiple buildings.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

WAN is a type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path.

WAN can also be defined as a group of local area networks that communicate with each other with a range above 50km.

use Leased-Line & Dial-up technology. 

Example of WAN is the Internet.

## Internetwork

**Intranet**: An internal network within an organization that enables employees to share data, collaborate, and access resources. Intranets are not accessible to the public and use private IP addresses.
    
**Extranet**: Extranets extend the intranet to authorized external users, such as business partners or clients. They provide controlled access to specific resources while maintaining security.
