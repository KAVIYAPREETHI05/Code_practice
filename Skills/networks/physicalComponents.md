## Types of Physical Components

**NIC(Network Interface Card)**
  It is a network adapter used to connect the computer to the network.
  
  It has a unique ID that is written on the chip, and it has a connector to connect the cable to it.

  - wired NIC
  - wireless NIC
    
 **HUB**

 A hub is a multi-port repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations. 
 
 Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.

 - Active hub
 - Passive hub
 - Switching hub
   
 **ROUTER**

 A Router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. The router is mainly a Network Layer device. 
 
 Routers normally connect LANs and WANs and have a dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets. 

 - Board band routers
 - Wireless routers
 - Wired routers
 - Edge routers
 - Core routers
 - Virtual router
 - Portable routers
   
 
 **MODEM**

 A Modem is a short form of Modulator/Demodulator. The Modem is a hardware component/device that can connect computers and other devices such as routers and switches to the internet.
 Modems convert or modulate the analog signals coming from telephone wire into a digital form that is in the form of 0s and 1s. 

 - Optical modem
 - Digital modem
 - Cable modem
 - Satellite modem
 - Dial modem

 **SWITCH**

 A Switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports implies less traffic) and performance. A switch is a data link layer device. 
 
 The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only.
 **NODES**

 
 **MEDIA**
 **REPEATER**
 **SERVER**
