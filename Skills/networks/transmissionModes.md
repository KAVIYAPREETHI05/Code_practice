## Transmission Modes

Transmission modes also known as communication modes, are methods of transferring data between devices on buses and networks designed to facilitate communication.

- Simplex Mode
- Half-Duplex Mode
- Full-Duplex Mode

**Simple Duplex**

In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. 

Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.

**Example:** Keyboard and traditional monitor

**Half-Duplex**

In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. 

When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.

**Example:** Walkie-talkie

**Full Duplex**

In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.

In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways: 

- Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and the other for receiving.
- the capacity is divided between signals traveling in both directions.

**Example:** Telephone

Parameters	|Simplex	|Half Duplex	|Full Duplex
------------|--------|---------------|-----------
The direction of communication	|Simplex mode is a uni-directional communication.	|Half Duplex mode is a two-way directional communication but one at a time.	|Full Duplex mode is a two-way directional communication simultaneously.
Sender and Receiver	|In simplex mode, Sender can send the data but that sender canâ€™t receive the data.|	In Half Duplex mode, Sender can send the data and also can receive the data but one at a time.	|In Full Duplex mode, Sender can send the data and also can receive the data simultaneously.
Channel usage	|Usage of one channel for the transmission of data.	|Usage of one channel for the transmission of data.|	Usage of two channels for the transmission of data.
Performance	|The simplex mode provides less performance than half duplex and full duplex.	|The Half Duplex mode provides less performance than full duplex.	|Full Duplex provides better performance than simplex and half duplex mode.
Bandwidth |Utilization	Simplex utilizes the maximum of a single bandwidth.	|The Half-Duplex involves lesser utilization of single bandwidth at the time of transmission.|	The Full-Duplex doubles the utilization of transmission bandwidth.
Suitable for	|It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of full bandwidth for delivering data.	|It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of sending data in both directions, but not at the same time.	|It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of sending and receiving data simultaneously in both directions.
Examples	|Example of simplex mode are: Keyboard and monitor.	|Example of half duplex mode is: Walkie-Talkies.|	Example of full duplex mode is: Telephone.
