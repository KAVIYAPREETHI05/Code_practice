## Kanban

### Visualize the entire workflow

Creating a Kanban board is your first step. This board is a visual display of your project's whole process, from beginning to end. You can choose a physical board with sticky notes or an online tool based on what your team likes and what the project requires.

The aim is to have a straightforward, available view of all tasks at any time, enabling every team member to comprehend the current status of the project and what the next steps are.

``to-do -> doing -> done``

### Organizing Work
Similar to breaking down epics into user stories in Scrum, the project's workload is divided into smaller, manageable tasks or items in Kanban. 

Each of these tasks is represented by a card that is placed in the appropriate column on the Kanban board according to its current status.

### Swim Lanes

Swim lanes are horizontal lines on your Kanban board that help categorize tasks into different streams or priorities, such as urgent tasks, specific project features, or work that pertains to different departments or teams. 

They provide an additional layer of organization that can make managing complex projects more straightforward.
