## SCRUM

Scrum is the most popular Agile methodology that was created in the mid-1980s, inspired by the dynamic and team-driven nature of rugby games. It draws from the ideas presented in "The New New Product Development Game" by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujijo Nonaka. Scrum uses a sprint-based approach to project management, where teams work in defined cycles to deliver increments of the product. This promotes adaptability and a swift response to changes, creating a collaborative environment that fosters transparency, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction. 
Though originally designed for software development, Scrum has proven effective across various fields, providing a robust strategy for managing projects in today's fast-paced and ever-evolving landscape.

### Three building blocks of Scrum

1. Agile roles are the people who are essential to every team. Among other things, they look after the business perspectives, speedy delivery, and technical proficiency.
2. Ceremonies are regular meetings that are conducted to facilitate Agile adherence and coordinate across complex initiatives.
3. Artifacts are measurable documents that provide both strategic and tactical direction to the team.

## Block 1- Roles

1. Product Owner

2. Scrum Master

3. Development Team

## Block 2 - Ceremonies
### Spring planning

Frequency: One per Sprint

Duration: Four to six hours for a one-month Sprint


Description:

Often the first event on the Scrum framework, this is where the Scrum team sizes the work to be done, determines what to include in the sprint, and what remains in the Backlog. They also discuss their initial plan for completing the items.
### Daily Scrum

Frequency: Daily

Duration: 15 minutes

Description:

The daily Scrum, also known as the daily stand-up, is a brief status meeting with all members of a Scrum team to provide regular updates and address challenges. 

### Sprint Review

Frequency: One per Sprint

Duration: Two to three hours for a one-month Sprint



Description: 

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.



This takes place at the end of the Sprint. The team shares the outcomes of the Sprint (completed user stories) with stakeholders and elicits feedback. It is also an opportunity to foster collaboration.



The Product Owner accepts or rejects the increment created by the development team.



Feedback is obtained from the product owner, development team, customer, and anyone else involved in the sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

Frequency: One per Sprint

Duration: Three hours for a one-month Sprint

Description:

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The Development Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regard to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored.

## Block 3 - Artifacts

After roles and ceremonies, the last of the three building blocks for all Scrum practices is artifacts.

Agile is based on the principle of customer value prioritization meaning that our focus is on delivering what the customer values the most. To figure out how to arrange our work to provide the most value to our customers in Scrum, we need to learn two main concepts: Prioritizing the backlog and user stories.

Artifact : Backlog

The Backlog contains all of the features and work that are needed to meet the customer's needs and wants. These are prioritized by the Product Owner who works with stakeholders to continuously organize the backlog so the highest value items are pushed to the top of the list. At the same time, less valuable items are pushed to the bottom of the backlog. 

### Epics

At the top of the hierarchy is an epic. This is a large body of work.



For example, “Ensure our small business can seamlessly transition services despite an upcoming e-commerce platform change.”

### Features
Epics are then broken down into features, which are distinct elements of functionality that offer capabilities to the customer.



For example, "As a business owner, I want to ensure a smooth migration to the new e-commerce platform so that all our services remain available without interruption."

### User Stories

Within features, we find user stories, which are descriptions of what the user wants, told from their perspective.



For example, "As a customer, I want to access all features of the new e-commerce platform seamlessly so that I can enjoy an uninterrupted shopping experience."

### Tasks

Tasks further break down user stories. These are specific activities needed to fulfill a user story according to the Definition of Done.



For example, "Review and update product listings for compatibility with the new platform, test all payment gateways for seamless transactions, and ensure customer data is securely transferred."


## prioritizing user stories

**must have** 

These are non-negotiable user stories that form the core of the product's value proposition. Without these, the product would fail to meet its fundamental purpose.

E.g. Core task categorization feature.

**should have**

Important features that, while not critical for the initial launch, significantly contribute to the product's value and should be included soon.

E.g. Notifications and calendar integration.

**could have**

Desirable functionalities that, although beneficial, are not crucial for the product at launch. These are often included as enhancements in later development cycles.

E.g. Gamification and customizable categories.

**won't have this time**

Features considered the lowest priority, either because they're "nice to have" or fall outside the current scope. These are not planned for immediate development but might be revisited in the future.

E.g. Social sharing features.
