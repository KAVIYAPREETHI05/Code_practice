## Agile

The digital age has brought new challenges and opportunities for project execution, especially in the fields of business, entrepreneurship, and academia. In the past, project development and  management relied on a linear, sequential approach called the **waterfall** model. 

This method, based on detailed upfront planning and phased execution, worked well for projects with fixed goals and clear requirements.

However, a new way of working emerged in the mid-1980s with the Agile methodologies developed by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujijo Nonaka. Agile introduced a flexible, iterative approach to project management, focusing on the incremental delivery and the ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements and new learning. This change was not just a minor change in practices but a fundamental shift in mindset, valuing adaptability and continuous improvement over the predictability of the waterfall model.

### Agile Methodologies

Agile prioritizes delivering tangible value and continuous improvement. It's built on collaboration, trust, and respect for those who do the work, believing they know best how to achieve it.
Agile also brings flexibility to project planning and scope, encouraging a mindset open to change and adaptation for better outcomes.
