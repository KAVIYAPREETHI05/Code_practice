ON-PREMISES DEPLOYMENT | CLOUD DEPLOYEMENT |HYBRID DEPLOYMENT
-------------|----------------------------|------------------
On-site, within the organizationâ€™s premises|	Hosted remotely by third-party provider|Combines on-premises and cloud resources
Organization owns hardware & infrastructure	|Cloud provider owns hardware, org rents services |Both on-premises infrastructure & cloud resources managed together
Upfront costs, ongoing maintenance costs	|Pay-as-you-go, no upfront investment|Flexible: Cloud for scalability, on-prem for consistency
Organization is fully responsible for management	|Cloud provider handles most management tasks |Combines on-prem control and cloud elasticity
Limited scalability, requires new hardware	|Elastic, easy to scale up or down |Shared management: On-prem + Cloud integration
More control but less flexibility	|More flexibility with ready-to-use services|Integrated security policies across both environments
Full control over security, but requires effort|	Shared responsibility with provider|High availability with redundancy options between on-prem and cloud
Depends on organization's infrastructure	|High availability, redundancy, SLAs|Combines control and flexibility in workload placement
