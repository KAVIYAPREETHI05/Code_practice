### Docker
**->** Docker is a virtualization software

**->** Packages application with all necessary dependencies, configuration, system tool and runtime

**->** Standardizes process of running any services on any local dev environment

**Containers:** Lightweight, portable units that encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently regardless of the environment.

**Docker Engine:** The runtime that enables the creation and management of containers.

**Docker Images:** Read-only templates that define the contents of a container, including the operating system, application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Images can be shared via Docker Hub or other registries.

**Dockerfile:** A text file that contains a series of instructions for building a Docker image. It allows for automated, repeatable builds of containers.

**Docker Hub:** A cloud-based repository where Docker users can share, store, and retrieve Docker images.

**Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a docker-compose.yml file, you can specify the services, networks, and volumes needed for your application.

**Orchestration Tools:** Tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes can be used to manage and scale Docker containers across multiple hosts, providing features like load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.
